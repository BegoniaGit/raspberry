- This is a knowledge base about Internet Technology. You can learn more or less from it.It's called **raspberry** because the knowledge base is like a lot of small particles on the surface of raspberries, because knowledge is just a little bit. A collection of knowledge. The knowledge base has gathered many knowledge points of the author's java direction learning, including JVM virtual machine ,computer network, http protocol, database system, and algorithm. In order to let myself review it repeatedly, this knowledge base is established. Strengthen your memory.Everyone must believe that knowledge is accumulated bit by bit, not a single trip.We can only achieve the height we want by toil and moil.
